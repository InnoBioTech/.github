# InnoBioTech LLC  
**AI-Driven CRO Discovery & Life Science Infrastructure**

InnoBioTech is building the next generation of **AI-native infrastructure for biotech and life sciences**.  
Our mission is to **remove friction between scientific intent and execution**—from assay discovery to data analysis—by combining **artificial intelligence, modern cloud engineering, and deep domain understanding**.

---

## What We’re Building

### 🔬 InnoEco — AI-Driven CRO Discovery
A smart marketplace that helps biotech and pharma teams **find, evaluate, and collaborate with the right CROs** based on scientific, regulatory, and operational fit—not just keywords.

Key ideas:
- Structured assay intelligence (not free text)
- Ontology-aware matching
- Quality, capacity, and compliance as first-class signals
- AI-assisted assay onboarding to reduce manual friction

---

### InnoOS — Intelligent Life Science Data Platform
A modular, cloud-native system for **analyzing, visualizing, and operationalizing complex biotech data** across assays and pipelines.

Core principles:
- Assay-aware data ingestion
- AI-assisted workflow orchestration
- Reproducibility by design
- Interactive, scientist-friendly visualization
- Compliance-ready architecture (GDPR, HIPAA, FDA-aligned)

---

## Why InnoBioTech Exists

Biotech innovation is slowed down by:
- Fragmented CRO discovery
- Unstructured assay descriptions
- Data silos across labs and vendors
- High dependency on manual expertise
- Complex pipelines that don’t scale

We believe **AI should act as a scientific co-pilot**, not a black box—accelerating decisions while preserving transparency and control.

---

## Technology Philosophy

- **AI where it matters**: semantic matching, knowledge extraction, workflow intelligence
- **Standards over chaos**: ontologies, schemas, reproducible pipelines
- **Cloud-native by default**: scalable, modular, and secure
- **Human-in-the-loop**: experts stay in control

---

## Repositories

This organization hosts:
- Core backend services
- AI agents and recommendation engines
- Infrastructure and deployment tooling
- Experimental prototypes and research components

Some repositories are private as we move toward production readiness.

---

## Collaboration & Contributions

We’re actively interested in collaborating with:
- Biotech & pharma teams
- CROs and lab service providers
- Bioinformatics engineers
- AI & data infrastructure experts

If you’re curious, skeptical, or excited—those are all good signs.
